## Hero 1 — Psycho

**Color:** `#1abc9c` (teal)
**Archetype:** Chaos disruptor — low HP glass cannon who thrives in unpredictability
**Stat Profile:** Low HP (45), high speed (5.5), high range damage (35), short cooldown (10), small projectiles

### Core Mechanic: Hysteria
Psycho has a **Hysteria Gauge** that fills as he takes damage and kills enemies. When full, he enters **Hysteria Mode** — movement speed +40%, all projectiles split into 3 erratic shots, and enemies near him randomly change direction (confused AI). Confused enemies display a swirling teal icon above their head for the debuff duration. Hysteria Mode lasts 6 seconds.

### Special: Mind Fracture
Fires a psychic bolt that bounces between up to 4 enemies, dealing damage and applying a 2s confusion debuff (enemies walk away from Psycho instead of toward him).

## Biome 1 — The Mindscape (Psycho)

**Key:** `psycho` → `window.BIOME_LOGIC['psycho']`
**Background:** `#0a1a18` (deep teal-black)
**Grid color:** `#1abc9c44` (transparent teal grid)

### Atmosphere
The arena feels unstable — pulsing teal energy lines crawl across the ground. Obstacles flicker and slightly shift position every 15 seconds ("glitch step"), telegraphed by a brief white flash. Ambient particles: small erratic sparks that drift in random directions.

### generate(arena)
- 12–16 rectangular obstacles, scattered asymmetrically, avoiding center spawn zone
- No traps — the environment itself disorients
- One large **Fracture Zone** (biome zone) covering 60% of arena: enemies inside occasionally stutter in place for 0.5s (visual only, no mechanical stun — matches the confusion theme)

### update(arena, player, enemies)
- Every 15s: each obstacle shifts by ±30px in a random direction (glitch step) with white flash
- Spawn 1–2 teal spark particles per frame near player (radius 800), drifting erratically
- During **Hysteria Mode**: particle spawn rate ×4, grid pulses brighter

### draw(ctx, arena)
- Background: deep teal-black fill + subtle teal radial glow around player
- Particles: small white/teal dots with short life, random velocity
- Active Hysteria overlay: screen-edge teal vignette flicker

### drawObstacle(ctx, obs)
- Base: dark teal `#0d2b27` with cracked surface texture (diagonal scratch lines)
- Bevel: teal highlight top-left, black shadow bottom-right
- Glitch state: white overlay flash when shifting, stutters to new position

## Hero 2 — Mirror

**Color:** `#1a5276` (marine blue)
**Archetype:** Reactive defender — punishes aggressive enemies, weak to ranged spam
**Stat Profile:** Medium HP (75), low speed (3.5), low range damage (12), high melee damage (140), long range cooldown (30)

### Core Mechanic: Reflection
Mirror's **special** creates a **Mirror Shield** (3s duration, fixed toggle) that reflects all incoming projectiles back at their source for 150% of original damage. Blocked projectiles also restore 5 HP each. Melee attacks against Mirror during Shield are reflected as a point-blank burst dealing 80% melee damage.

### Special: Shatter
Fires a slow-moving mirror shard that splits into 6 fragments on contact with an enemy or wall, each fragment dealing 60% of base range damage. Fragments travel outward in a star pattern.

## Biome 2 — The Hall of Mirrors (Mirror)

**Key:** `mirror` → `window.BIOME_LOGIC['mirror']`
**Background:** `#050d14` (near-black deep blue)
**Grid color:** `#1a527644` (transparent marine blue)

### Atmosphere
Vast, cold, geometric. The arena is lined with reflective panel obstacles that shimmer and show distorted inversions of the player's position. Ambient light refracts off surfaces, casting moving prismatic streaks across the floor.

### generate(arena)
- 8–12 tall, narrow rectangular obstacles arranged in rough parallel rows — evoking mirror panels in a maze
- Obstacles are larger than average (width 40–60, height 200–300) to create corridors
- 4–6 **Mirror Panels** placed along arena walls: purely decorative, but same visual as obstacles, framing the arena

### update(arena, player, enemies)
- Every 8s: prismatic light streak sweeps across the full arena floor (left-to-right or diagonal), lasts 1.5s — purely visual, no gameplay effect
- Each frame: spawn 1 faint blue-white glint particle on any obstacle surface near player (sparkle effect)
- When Mirror Shield is active: all obstacles pulse with a brief white glow

### draw(ctx, arena)
- Background: deep blue-black fill + faint radial blue glow (large, dim) centered on arena
- Prismatic sweep: thin diagonal gradient strip (white → transparent) animating across floor
- Particle glints: tiny white dots with very short life (20 frames), spawned on obstacle edges

### drawObstacle(ctx, obs)
- Base: dark marine blue `#0a1f30` with smooth finish (no texture lines — polished look)
- Surface highlight: thin bright line along top and left edges (simulates reflective sheen)
- Interior: subtle radial gradient — slightly lighter center fading to dark edges
- Bevel: bright marine blue top-left, near-black bottom-right
- Border: `#0d2840` stroke

## Hero 3 — Smoke

**Color:** `#5a5a6e` (slate gray)
**Archetype:** Control specialist — area denial, positional play, punishes melee clusters
**Stat Profile:** Medium HP (65), high speed (5), medium range damage (20), medium melee damage (100), medium cooldown (18)

### Core Mechanic: Smoke Trail
Whenever Smoke **dashes**, it leaves a smoke cloud at the origin point (radius 60, lasts 4s). Enemies inside smoke clouds have their speed reduced by 40% and move semi-randomly (lose targeting accuracy). Clouds are visible to all players in co-op and versus modes. Max 3 simultaneous clouds.

### Special: Blackout
Releases a large burst cloud (radius 120) centered on player, dealing light damage to all enemies caught in it and applying a 3s blind debuff — blinded enemies cannot target Smoke (attack nearby empty space instead). 12s cooldown.

### Upgrade Pool

- Projectile: dark gray smoke bolt, leaves faint trailing particles
- Special: expanding dark smoke burst, fades from center outward
- Smoke clouds: circular semi-transparent gray overlays with slow swirl animation

## Biome 3 — The Smog Quarter (Smoke)

**Key:** `smoke` → `window.BIOME_LOGIC['smoke']`
**Background:** `#0f0f14` (near-black gray)
**Grid color:** `#5a5a6e33` (transparent slate)

### Atmosphere
Industrial ruin. Visibility is reduced by a persistent gray haze that covers the arena. Obstacles are crumbling concrete blocks half-swallowed by drifting smoke. Particles: slow-rolling smoke wisps that drift in a consistent wind direction.

### generate(arena)
- 14–18 square/blocky obstacles scattered throughout, more dense than average — creates chokepoints and cover opportunities that reward Smoke's positional play
- 3–4 large **Smog Pockets** (biome zones): all enemies entering lose 15% speed regardless of Smoke's active clouds (stacks with Smoke's clouds)
- Wind direction chosen at arena gen (random cardinal): smoke particles all drift that way

### update(arena, player, enemies)
- Each frame: spawn 2–3 smoke wisp particles at random arena positions, drifting in wind direction, slow velocity, long life (400–600 frames), large radius (8–15), low alpha
- Every 20s: wind direction shifts 90° clockwise — brief `showNotification("WIND SHIFT")` in gray
- Visibility effect: draw a global semi-transparent gray overlay (`rgba(15,15,20,0.25)`) over entire arena — applies regardless of which hero is playing. Enemies beyond radius 500 from player are dimmed further in draw pass.

### draw(ctx, arena)
- Background: near-black fill + diffuse gray radial fog (large, low opacity, player-centered)
- Smoke wisps: large soft circles (low alpha, `#8888aa` to `#555566`), drifting in wind direction
- Visibility vignette: dark gray overlay around screen edges, thinning at center

### drawObstacle(ctx, obs)
- Base: dark cracked concrete `#1a1a22` with rough texture (horizontal crack lines, varied spacing)
- Surface: soot staining — random dark patches drawn as low-opacity filled rects
- Bevel: light gray top-left edge (faded), near-black bottom-right
- Border: `#111118` stroke, slightly thicker than default

## index.js Structure (outline)

```js
const DISCIPLES_OF_DECEPTION = {
    id: 'disciples_of_deception',
    name: "Disciples of Deception",
    heroes: ['psycho', 'mirror', 'smoke'],
    description: "Introduces three deception-themed heroes: Psycho (Teal), Mirror (Marine Blue), and Smoke (Slate Gray).",

    load: async function() {
        // Load hero scripts
        await dlcManager.loadScript('dlc/disciples_of_deception/PsychoHero.js');
        await dlcManager.loadScript('dlc/disciples_of_deception/MirrorHero.js');
        await dlcManager.loadScript('dlc/disciples_of_deception/SmokeHero.js');
        // Load biome scripts
        await dlcManager.loadScript('dlc/disciples_of_deception/MindscapeBiome.js');
        await dlcManager.loadScript('dlc/disciples_of_deception/HallOfMirrorsBiome.js');
        await dlcManager.loadScript('dlc/disciples_of_deception/SmogQuarterBiome.js');

        this.injectHero();       // × 3 heroes
        this.injectBiome();      // registers BIOME_LOGIC keys + dlcBiomes list entry
        this.injectAltar();      // × 3 heroes
        this.injectAchievements();

        // Register SFX
        audioManager.registerSounds({
            // SFX ...
        });

        // Register voice exclamation paths
        audioManager.registerExclamationPath('psycho', (s) => `dlc/disciples_of_deception/audio/voices/psycho/${s}.mp3`);
        audioManager.registerExclamationPath('mirror', (s) => `dlc/disciples_of_deception/audio/voices/mirror/${s}.mp3`);
        audioManager.registerExclamationPath('smoke',  (s) => `dlc/disciples_of_deception/audio/voices/smoke/${s}.mp3`);

        // NO: injectStory / injectMemories / injectStoryArcLabels
    }
};
```

> **Note:** `injectBiome()` must push `'psycho'`, `'mirror'`, `'smoke'` into the `dlcBiomes` array in `game.js:advanceWave()`. Biomes then enter the standard random pool for all heroes in non-story runs — same behavior as `earth`, `lightning`, `gravity`, etc.

## Resolved Design Decisions

| Topic                             | Decision                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hysteria confusion visual         | Swirling teal icon above confused enemy for debuff duration        |
| Smoke clouds in multiplayer       | Visible to all players (co-op and versus)                          |
| Smog Quarter visibility reduction | Global — applies to all heroes, not just Smoke                     |
| DLC music | None — base game music plays in all biomes |
| Biome random pool                 | Added to standard DLC pool, appears for any hero in non-story runs |
